  <p>Investment Strategy
We will have an excel sheet to monitor our safe bet portfolio size, so we allocate capital accordingly with our investment criteria.</p>
<p>80% of our funds will go towards the Safe Bets
 Here we want capital light companies, with a huge chunk of cash and strong cash generation. Names well positioned to keep their legacy for at least 15 years. They also need to beat the market (we should include the VTI here as well.</p>
<p>20% to the Fast Growing companies 
 according to Peter Lynch, one criteria for the tenbaggers is the fact that they are small and fast growing.</p>
<p>Tail Risk Hedge
It's not that hard to do yourself.</p>
<p>Just continuously buy really cheap out-of-the-money put options. A little each month. And wait.</p>
<p>I tried it some years ago. It's easy to set up.</p>
<p>However, I failed in the patience department so no gains this time around.</p>
