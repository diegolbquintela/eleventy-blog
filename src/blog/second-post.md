title: Building Wealth
---

Building wealth is about accumulating assets that grow in time, thus, generating a compound effect where your initial investment is generating cash flow.

If you want to get rich with the stock market, you only have two choices:
Boost your monthly investments.

As a consequence, you will have to increase your monthly income;
Increase your rate of return, your Compound Annual Growth Rate.

Therefore, put the hours into learning how to evaluate a business and pick individual stocks.

A wiser approach would be to do both. You don't have to learn how to evaluate every business on earth.

A simple combination between an index fund investment and some stocks that you carry in-depth knowledge is enough to improve your CAGR by a couple of points already.

The same applies to your monthly income. If you are in a job where your possibility of growth is capped, learn in-demand skills (coding), or start a business.

There is an abundance of free resources to learn to code on the web. You just have to put the hours.

For the business route, a small store… you don't need complexity here - the simple bread and butter works.

I know a person that built a small local store using Instagram as a distribution platform. She buys products from Shoppee and Ali Express, puts them in a customized, branded box, and deliver the products in person every Friday.

She started in March and is already making five digits a month, and is hiring her first employer.

To market her brand, she paid local influencers (in some cases cash, in others sent a free box).
The Wealth Building Formulae is simple: hold equity.

One either own equity that is increasing in value or buys more equity.
Either increase your CAGR or increase your periodical asset purchase - improving both is superior.
