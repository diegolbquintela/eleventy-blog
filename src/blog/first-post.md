How I am learning to code
Sharing the framework that I've been using to learn a new skill at 29 will help me break into tech or learn whatever else I want.

A brief background, I've never been a 100% 'J' - or Judging - on Meyers and Briggs. I know it has been debunked, but the point here is the characteristic by itself. I've always been passionate about art, at the same time, loved math, was very good in physics at High School, and so on.

These knowledge areas may appear rival within each other, I've been transitioning between than for 10 years.

I graduated in Economics with a strong quantitative foundation. I also took some Econometrics classes as electives, did courses, read books on the subject, etc.

I also studied Finance by myself, started with the classic investing books, learned some accounting, studying for the CFA, and passed level 1 and level 2.

Although I don't need to take level 3 to keep practicing my current profession, I plan on taking level 3 for the sake of finishing what I started.

Every narrative has an ending. One should always complete whatever they start.
To be more specific: I am a Financial Advisor, full-time Investor - my investing method is purely qualitative and business rooted. Bachelor of Economics with a strong foundation in statistics, Econometrics, and Financial Econometrics. Passionate about classic literature and Western History, philosophy, theology, epistemology, and art in general.

If there is one thing that I've learned in my journey as a Programmer-to-be, it is that every big problem can break into smaller pieces and that you can express logic as a function. In this case, learning is a function of time and practice. If you practice and put in the time, you will learn whatever you want.
Indeed, we are all born with some inept abilities.

I will never play football like Kevin de Bruyne. Still, I can become as good as a standard football player.

Try setting goals and schedules for what you are doing at the moment. For example, if you are investing, set a goal: your first 1k, your first 10k, or learn how to read a company earnings report and so on Helps a lot. Also, make your goals public, be accountable.

You can learn/do everything if you put the hours into it.

My goal is to become a web developer and start working by December/2021. I started learning to code on October 4th.
Materials

I'm following the route of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am using:

Udemy courses - List below
Eloquent JavaScript
Free Code Camp
Code Wars - Started doing the 8kyu questions and plan on moving to Leet Code when I get better at solving 5kyu questions.

These are the courses that I will use in my journey:
HTML AND CSS COURSE - With a full complete Project by Simon Angatia
The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp, by Dr. Angela Yu
The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From zero to expert, by Jonas Schmedtmann
JavaScript: Understanding the weird parts, by Anthony Alicea
The coding interview Bootcamp, by Stephen Grider
HTML and CSS Course, by Simon Angatia
React - The complete guide, by Academind (Maximilian Schwarzmüller)
Modern React with Redux, by Stephen Grider

Breaking down my process into three simple rules

1. Tracking my hours weekly. My goal is to incrementally increase the hours that I dedicate to code.
   Thanks to a Dutch member of an investing community that I am building with my friend Matheus, I found an excellent tracking app called Forest.
   I started by coding 8 hours and 15 minutes a week.
   Breaking down my weekly hours studied:
   8:15
   12:30
   15:25
   14:38
   12:45
   17:00
   18:00
   18:03

The trend is clear. I will keep pushing my hours up. Although I have my work, wife, gym, Russian literature, Boardwalk Empire rewatches, investing, the Orpheus Community, etc. I will put the hours here, the maximum that I can.

2. No. Zero. Days. Thanks to the (link text), I started applying this heuristic to everything that I begin.
   You can control it using two rules:
   No. Zero. Days.
   Every journey has an ending: only start what you can finish.

Small victories will give you the confidence to move forward and to keep pushing. Secure that by setting an end goal and working every day until you met that goal.

Turn yourself into a serial winner.
In terms of coding, even if I don't feel like studying or working on a particular day, I will try to practice for one section.

Small sections of 35 minutes each because this allows me to rest my vision, and get up, stretch my back for a couple, correct my posture - you only get one body.
Usually, I rest for 5–10 minutes, and then I come back to coding until doing at least three hours a day.

There are days that I can push it for 4, 5 hours of coding (no client meetings, no plans with the wife, no football game). Sometimes, I can only do it for like 1 hour and 10 minutes (until now, it only happened when I had family obligations or client meetings).

3. Don't get bored with coding. Get bored with what you are doing

   Those who already read some of my essays or talked to me know that I'm obsessed with the Incerto series from Nassim Taleb. I have a list of books that I reread annually. The Incerto series is part of that annual recycling.
   I don't know if he was the father of this idea (I don't care, to be honest), but one of the heuristics that he expresses in his work is "Be bored of the book, not of reading."
   Practice it.

   If, for some reason, it stops being meaningful for you, change the task, not the venture. Our body is quite robust in signaling to us when it is the right time to do something, and we tend to not listen to it.
   There are days that your mind needs to rest a bit to dissolve all the theory that you learned. Others you need full-on practice or a mix of that.
   Again, if you feel bored with your current activity, do something else within the realm of what you are learning.

   At one time, in one of my Udemy courses, I was learning DOM manipulation. For some reason, I wasn't learning anything (maybe my mind was still processing what I've learned in the section before). Here I had two choices: be inefficient, wasting hours trying to memorize something that I would forget in a matter of days, or changing the activity.

   I bought another course, started from scratch, did more CodeWars problems aligned with Free Code Camp challenges, and move forward.

   Some days later, I went back to the DOM manipulation, learned it, and built my first project using it.
   Give your mind some time to absorb things. Use that time to practice other skills. There are so many areas in programming that you will always have something to learn.
   What you want to develop is a naturally curious personality, where you always want to learn something. At the same time, a practical approach, where you are always building and practicing something (this will reduce your burden of learning a subject)

This framework works for anything that you want to learn. Remember that you always have to finish what you start, so don't pick endless journeys, as Lucius Seneca would advise us.
